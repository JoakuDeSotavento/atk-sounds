# Sound Examples for Ambisonic Toolkit

A number of 30 second extracts from published and unpublished recordings.

## Using the example files with Reaper

These example files are not required in order for ATK for Reaper to work, but they may come in handy when testing the various encoders, transformers and decorders in Reaper projects.

## Installing example files for SuperCollider

For full featured help examples in ATK for SuperCollider, these ATK example soundfiles are required. Install [ATK for SuperCollider](http://ambisonictoolki.github.io/download/supercollider/), then download the sound example files here.

Launch SuperCollider3 and run the following code:

```
Soundfile examples
(
  // Place unzipped kernels in the directory opened
  // Presume Atk.userSupportDir has already been created
  Atk.openUserSupportDir;
)
```


If the ATK has been correctly installed, the above code will open the ATK's user support directory. Place the downloaded soundfiles here.

*Note:* Users are strongly advised to download and install these files.
